the NerdLog class intended to be stolen and reused
    this generally recomended when you don't want/know how to use advantagekit.
    NerdLog class is compatable with advantageScope

initialize() {
    starts the class
    ALWAYS place in robot constructor, but after everything that contains everything that has a variation of logVariable()
}

periodic() {
    run in robot periodic
}

there may be multiple methods of the variation of:

addVariableToLog() {
    required in order to log  a variable
}

logVariable(var variable) {
    will run variable into the logs and also the networktables 
}

using annotations {
    
}
